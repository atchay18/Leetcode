Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  
This repo is where I drop my Java solutions for LeetCode problems. I'm solving these to practice for interviews, learn cool tricks, and just get better at coding.

What's Inside?
- Java code for a bunch of LeetCode problems
- Clean and readable solutions (most of the time ðŸ˜…)
  
Enjoy and happy coding! ðŸš€
